        <p align = "center">
            My name is Colton Craig. Ever since I was little, I have loved electronics with all my heart.
            My childhood facination was mostly video games. I thought they were fun and entertaining. I 
            always loved playing it for the story and for having fun times with my family. During that time,
            I really wanted to become a video game developer. As I have become older, video games still remain
            an important part of my life. Not only has video games been important to me, but I use electronics daily.
            Electronics has been so important in my life that I want to contribute to it. That is why I am personally
            learning how to code and how to become better in the world of electronics.
