       <h2>Purpose</h2>
       <p>The purpose of The Weather Site is to give current weather
          conditions in 3 different ways.  The initial page will give
          the weather for the current location based on the Geocoding
          location information from the device.  The second is weather
          for 3 specific locations accessible through a dedicated link,
          and the third is weather for any location determined by a search
          string.</p>
